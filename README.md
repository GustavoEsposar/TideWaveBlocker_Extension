# TideWaveBlocker Chromium Extension

## Design considerations

The extension is tailored to function in Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The tutorial focuses solely on demonstrating its use in Chrome (although it's important to mention that the tutorial applies to any extension not listed in the browser store).
